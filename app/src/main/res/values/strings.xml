        Experiment with adding an ImageView above the TextView inside the ScrollView.
        \n\nWhen you run the app, this image, unlike the star, will scroll out of view as the text scrolls up.
        \n\nThe important thing to remember is that since ScrollView can only have one child,
        you have to wrap that ImageView and the TextView into a LinearLayout.
        \n\nThere is no solution code provided for this challenge, but the skeleton code below gives you the expected view hierarchy to use.
